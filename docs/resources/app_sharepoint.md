- `app_slo_location_enabled` (Boolean) enable application SLO location
- `description` (String) Sharepoint application description
- `ida` (String) identity appliane name
- `idp` (Block List) SP to IDP SAML 2 settings (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--idp))
- `name` (String) resource name
- `saml2` (Block List) SP SAML 2 settings (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--saml2))
- `sts_encrypting_cert_subject` (String) STS encrypting certificate subject
- `sts_signing_cert_subject` (String) STS signing certificate subject

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `sp_id` (String) SAML SP internal name

<a id="nestedblock--keystore"></a>
### Nested Schema for `keystore`

Required:
